Traffic Sign Detection in python using YOLOv8 model and kaggle image dataset

I have successfully completed a project on traffic sign image detection using the YOLO model in Python, hosted on Google Colab. This endeavor was supported by meticulously curated datasets from Kaggle and Roboflow.

Key Highlights:
- Leveraging Google Colab for collaborative coding and seamless execution.
- Utilization of diverse datasets from Kaggle and Roboflow to ensure robust model training and testing.
- Implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model in Python for efficient real-time object detection.
- Its a basic project identifying and training a model with different traffic signs
